# kMeans-Anomalies-Detector-for-Pregnant-Diabetic-Patients

I will be using a clustering algorithm called KMeans clustering along with a dimensionality reduction algorithm called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
I will make use of the Diabetes dataset which belongs to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
The patients in this dataset are 21 years of age and older and are Pima Indians.
